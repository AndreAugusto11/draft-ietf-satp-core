--- abstract

This memo describes the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) Protocol for digital assets. SAT is a protocol operating between two gateways that conducts the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to another. The protocol establishes a secure channel between the endpoints and implements a 2-phase commit (2PC) to ensure the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.

--- middle

# Introduction
{: #introduction}

This memo proposes a secure asset transfer protocol (SATP) that is intended to be deployed between two gateway endpoints to transfer a digital asset from an origin network to a destination network.

 Both the origin and destination networks are assumed to be opaque
 in the sense that the interior constructs of a given network
 is not read/write accessible to unauthorized entities.

The protocol utilizes the asset burn-and-mint paradigm whereby the asset
 to be transferred is permanently disabled or destroyed (burned)
 at the origin network and is re-generated (minted) at the destination network.
 This is achieved through the coordinated actions of the peer gateways
 handling the unidirectional transfer at the respective networks.

A gateway is assumed to be trusted to perform the tasks involved in the asset transfer.

The overall aim of the protocol is to ensure that the state of assets
 in the origin and destination networks remain consistent,
 and that asset movements into (out of) networks via gateways can be accounted for.

There are several desirable technical properties of the protocol.
 The protocol must ensure that the properties of atomicity, consistency,
 isolation, and durability (ACID) are satisfied.

The requirement of consistency implies that the
 asset transfer protocol always leaves both networks
 in a consistent state (that the asset is located in
 one system/network only at any time).

Atomicity means that the protocol must guarantee
 that either the transfer commits (completes) or entirely fails,
 where failure is taken to mean there is no change to the
 state of the asset in the origin (sender) network.

The property of isolation means that while a transfer
 is occurring to a digital asset from an origin network,
 no other state changes can occur to the asset.

The property of durability means that once
 the transfer has been committed by both gateways,
 that this commitment must hold regardless of subsequent
 unavailability (e.g. crash) of the gateways implementing the SAT protocol.

All messages exchanged between gateways are assumed to run over TLS1.2,
 and the endpoints at the respective gateways are associated with
 a certificate indicating the legal owner (or operator) of the gateway.

# The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol
{: #satp-protocol}

## Overview
{: #satp-overview}

 The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) is a gateway-to-gateway protocol used by a sender gateway with a recipient gateway to perform a unidirectional transfer of a digital asset.

The protocol defines a number of API endpoints, resources and identifier definitions, and message flows corresponding to the asset transfer between the two gateways.

The current document pertains to the interaction between gateways through API2.

## SAT Model
{: #satp-model}

The model for SATP is shown in Figure 1.
The model for SATP is shown in Figure 1.
The Client (application) interacts with its local gateway (G1) over an interface (API1) in order to provide instructions to the gateway with regards to actions to assets and related resources located in the local system or network (NW1).

Gateways interact with each other over a gateway interface (API2). A given gateway may be required to access resources that are not located in network NW1 or network NW2. Access to these types of resources are performed over an off-network interface (API3).

## Family of APIs
{: #satp-apitypes}

The following are the types of APIs in SATP:

- Gateway APIs for client (API1):
This is the API that allows a Client (application) to interact with a local gateway and issue instructions for actions pertaining to resources accessible to the gateway.

- Gateway APIs for peer gateways (API2):
These are the APIs employed by two (2) peer gateways for performing unidirectional asset transfers.

- APIs for validation of off-network resources (API3):
These are the APIs made available by a resource server (resource owner) that a gateway can use to access resources.

The use of these APIs is dependent on the mode of access and the type of flow in question.

## Types of Flows
{: #satp-flowtypes}

The SAT protocol defines the following three (3) flows:

- Transfer Initiation flow:
This flow deals with commencing a transfer from one gateway to another. Several tasks are involved, including (but not limited to):
(i) gateway identification and mutual authentication;
(ii) exchange of asset type (definition) information;
(iii) verification of the asset definition, and others.

- Lock-Assertion flow:
This flow deals with the conveyance of signed assertions from the sender gateway to the receiver gateway regarding the locked status of an asset at the origin network.

- Commitment Establishment flow:
This flow deals with the asset transfer and commitment establishment between two gateways.

These flows will be discussed below.


# SATP Message Format, identifiers and Descriptors
{: #satp-messages-identifiers}

## Overview
{: #satp-message-identifier-overview}

This section describes the stages of SATP, the format of the messages exchanged between two gateways and the format for resource descriptors.

The following lists all of the message payloads in SATP. The mandatory fields are determined by the message type exchanged between the two gateways (see Section 7).


## SATP Message Format and Payloads
{: #satp-message-format}

SATP messages are exchanged between peer gateways, where depending on the message type one gateway may act as a client of the other (and vice versa).


### Protocol version
This refers to SATP protocol Version, encoded as "major.minor" (separated by a period symbol).


### Message Type
This refers to the type of request or response to be conveyed in the message. 

The possible values are:

- transfer-init-request: Request to begin transfer parameter negotiations.

- transfer-init-response: Response to the request for parameter negotiations.

- transfer-commence-msg: Request to begin the commencement of the asset transfer.

- ack-commence-msg: Response to accept to the commencement of the asset transfer.

- lock-assert-msg: Sender gateway has performed the lock of the asset in the origin network.

- assertion-receipt-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving of the signed lock-assert-msg.

- commit-prepare-msg: Sender gateway requests the start of the commitment stage.

- ack-prepare-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving the previous commit-prepare-msg and agrees to start the commitment stage.

- commit-final-msg: Sender gateway has performed the extinguishment (burn) of the asset in the origin network.

- ack-commit-final-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving of the signed commit-final-msg and has performed the asset creation and assignment in the destination network.

- commit-transfer-complete-msg: Sender gateway indicates closure of the current transfer session.


### Digital Asset Identifier

This is the unique identifier (UUIDv2) that uniquely identifies the digital asset in the origin network which is to be transferred to the destination network.

The digital asset identifier is a value that is derived by the applications utilized by the originator and the beneficiary prior to starting the asset transfer.

The mechanism used to derive the digital asset identifier is outside the scope of the current document.


### Session ID:

This is the unique identifier (UUIDv2) representing a session between two gateways handling a single unidirectional transfer. This may be derived from the context-ID at the application level.


### Transfer-Context ID

This is the unqiue optional identifier (UUIDv2) representing the application layer context.


Sequence Number: 

This is an increasing counter uniquely representing a message from a session. This can be utilikzed used to assist the peer gateways when they are processing multiple simultaneous unrelated transfers.




### Gateway Credential Type

This is the type type of authentication mechanism supported by the gateway (e.g.  SAML, OAuth, X.509)


### Gateway Credential 

This payload is the actual credential of the gateway (token, certificate, string, etc.).


### Payload Hash

This is the hash of the current message payload.


### Signature Algorithms Supported

This is the list of digital signature algorithm supported by a gateway, with the base default being the NIST ECDSA standard.


### Message Signature 

This payload is the actual the ECDSA signature portion over a message.





## Negotiation of Security Protocols and Parameters

{: #satp-negotiation-params-sec}

We present the negotiation stage of the protocols and their parameters.

### TLS Established
{: #satp-tls-Established-sec}

TLS 1.2 or higher MUST be implemented to protect gateway communications. TLS 1.3 or higher SHOULD be implemented where both gateways support TLS 1.3 or higher.

### Client offers supported credential schemes
{: #satp-client-offers-sec}

Capability negotiation, similar to the Session Description Protocol [RFC5939], occurs prior to data exchange. Initially, the client (application) sends a JSON block containing acceptable credential schemes, such as OAuth2.0 or SAML, in the "Credential Scheme" field of the SATP message.

### Server selects supported credential scheme
{: #satp-server-selects-sec}

The server (recipient Gateway) selects one acceptable credential scheme from the offered schemes, returning the selection in the "Credential Scheme" field of the SATP message. If no acceptable credential scheme was offered, an HTTP 511 "Network Authentication Required" error is returned in the Action/Response field of the SATP message.

### Client asserts or proves identity
{: #client-procedure-sec}

The details of the assertion/verification step are specific to the chosen credential scheme and are outside the scope of this document.

### Sequence numbers initialized
{: #sequence-numbers-sec}

Sequence numbers are used to allow the server to correctly order operations from the client. Some operations may be asynchronous, synchronous, or idempotent with duplicate requests handled differently according to the use case. The initial sequence number is proposed by the client (sender gateway) after credential verification is finalized. The server (recipient gateway) MUST respond with the same sequence number to indicate acceptance. The client increments the sequence number with each new request. Sequence numbers can be reused for retries in the event of a gateway timeout.

### Messages can now be exchanged
{: #satp-msg-exchnge-sec}

Handshaking is complete at this point, and the client can send SAT messages to perform actions on resources, which MAY reference the SAT Payload field.

## Asset Profile Identification
{: #satp-asset-profile-negotiation}

The client and server must mutually agree on the asset type or profile that is the subject of the current transfer. The client provides the server with the asset identification number, or the server may provide the client with the asset identification numbers for the digital asset it supports. Formal specification of asset identification is outside the scope of this document. Globally numbering digital asset types or profiles is expected to be performed by a legally recognized entity.




# Overview of Message Flows
{: #satp-flows-overview-section}

The SATP message flows are logically divided into three (3) stages, with the preparatory stage denoted as Stage-0. How the tasks are achieved in Stage-0 is out of scope for the current document.

The Stage-1 flows pertains to the initialization of the transfer between the two gateways.  

After both gateways agree to commence the transfer at the start of Stage-2, the sending gateway G1 must deliver a signed assertion that it has performed the correct lock (burn) on the asset in network NW1. If that assertion is accepted by gateway G2, it must in return transmit a signed receipt to gateway G1 that it has created (minted) a temporary asset in NW2.

The Stage-3 flows commits gateways G1 and G2 to the burn and mint in Stage-2. The reader is directed to [SATP-ARCH] for further discussion of this model.

# Identity and Asset Verification Flow (Stage 0)
{: #satp-Stage0-section}

Prior to commencing the asset transfer from the sender gateway (client) to the recipient gateway (server), both gateways must perform a number of verifications steps. The types of information required by both the sender and recipient are use-case dependent and asset-type dependent.

The verifications include, but not limited to, the following:

- Gateway identity mutual verification:
This is the identity of the gateway at the protocol and network layer.
This may include validating the X509 certificates of the gateways.


- Gateway owner verification:
This is the verification of the identity (e.g. LEI) of the owners of the gateways.

- Gateway device and state validation:
This is the device attestation evidence [RATS]
that a gateway must collect and convey to each other,
where a verifier is assumed to be available to decode,
parse and appraise the evidence.

- Originator and beneficiary identity verification:
This is the identity and public-key of the entity (originator)
in the origin network seeking to transfer the asset to
another entity (beneficiary) in the destination network.

These are considered out of scope in the current specifications,
 and are assumed to have been successfully completed prior to
 the commencement of the transfer initiation flow.



# Transfer Initiation and Commencement Flows (Stage 1)
{: #satp-stage1-section}
 This section describes the SATP Set-up stage,
where a sender gateway interacts with a recipient gateway, proposing a session.

These artifacts are contained in the Transfer Initiation Claims.

 Gateways MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST methods
defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] for the endpoint.

 Clients (sender gateway) MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send messages
in this stage to the server (recipient gateway).
If using the HTTP GET method, the request parameters may be
serialized using URI Query String Serialization.

 The client and server may be required to sign certain messages
in order to provide standalone proof (for non-repudiation)
independent of the secure channel between the client and server.
This proof may be required for audit verifications (e.g. post-event).

(NOTE: Flows occur over TLS. Nonces are not shown).





## Transfer Initialization Claims
{: #satp-stage1-init-claims}
This is set of artifacts pertaining to the asset that
 must be agreed upon between the client (sender
gateway) and the server (recipient gateway).

The Transfer Initialization Claims consists of the following:

- digital_asset_id: This is the globally unique identifier for the digital asset
located in the origin network.

- asset_profile_id: This is the globally unique identifier for the asset-profile
definition (document) on which the digital asset was issued.

- verified_originator_entity_id: This is the identity data of the originator entity
(person or organization) in the origin network.
This information must be verified by the sender gateway.

- verified_beneficiary_entity_id: This is the identity data of the beneficiary entity
(person or organization) in the destination network.
This information must be verified by the receiver gateway.

 - originator_pubkey REQUIRED. This is the public key of the asset owner (originator)
in the origin network or system.

 - beneficiary_pubkey REQUIRED. This is the public key of the beneficiary
in the destination network.

 - sender_gateway_network_id REQUIRED. This is the identifier of the
origin network or system behind the client.

 - recipient_gateway_network_id REQUIRED. This is the identifier of the destination
network or system behind the server.

 - client_identity_pubkey REQUIRED. The public key of client who sent this message.

 - server_identity_pubkey REQUIRED. The public key of server for whom this message is intended.


- sender_gateway_owner_id: This is the identity information of the owner or operator
of the sender gateway.

- receiver_gateway_owner_id: This is the identity information of the owner or operator
of the recipient gateway.







## Conveyance of Network Capabilities and Parameters
{: #satp-stage1-conveyance}

 This is set of artifacts pertaining to the origin network behind
 the client (sender gateway) that MAY be communicated to the server (recipient gateway).
 A server may accept the asset-related claims but reject the
 transfer request based on parameters of the origin network.

# SATP Session Resumption
{: #satp-session-resume-section}
This section answers the question how can a backup gateway build trust
with the counter party gateway to resume the execution of the protocol,
in the presence of errors and crashes?

Gateways may enter faulty state at any time while execution the protocol.
The faulty state can manifest itself by incorrect behavior,
leading to gateways emitting alerts and errors.

In some instances, gateways may crash.
We employ either the primary-backup or self-healing paradigm,
meaning that the crashed gateway will eventually be replaced
by a functioning one, or recover, respectively.


When a crash occurs, we initiate a recovery procedure by
the backup gateway or the recovered gateway, as defined in the
crash recovery draft {{?I-D.draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery}}.
In either case, if the recovery happenswithin a time period defined as max_timeout (in Stage 2), the recovered gateway triggers a session resumption.
The schema and order of the recovered messages is specified in the crash recovery draft.


In the case where there is no answer from the gateway within the specified max_timeout,
the counter-party gateway rollbacks the process until that stage.
Upon recovery, the crashed gateway learns that the counterparty gateway
has initated a rollback, and it proceeds accordingly (by also initating a rollback).
Note that rollbacks can also happen in case of unresolved errors.


The non-crashed gateway that conducts the rollback tries to communicate
with the crashed gateway from time to time (self healing) or to contact
the backup gateways (primary-backup).
In any case, and upon the completion of a rollback,
the non-crashed gateway sends a ROLLBACK message
to the recovered gateway to notify that a rollback happened.
The recovered gateway should answer with ROLLBACK-ACK.

Since the self-healing recovery process does not require
changes to the protocol (since from the counterparty gateway perspective,
the sender gateway is just taking longer than normal;
there are no new actions done or logs recorded),
we focus on the primary-backup paradigm.


## Primary-Backup Session Resumption
{: #satp-session-resume-section-pb}


 Upon a gateway recovering using primary-backup,
 a new gateway (recovered gateway) takes over the crashed gateway.
 The counter-party gateway assures that the recovered gateway
 is legitimate (according to the crash recovery specification).

 After the recovery, the gateways exchange information about
 their current view of the protocol, since the crashed gateway
 may have been in the middle of executing the protocol when it crashed.

 After that, the gateways agree on the current state of the protocol.




## Recovery Messages
{: #satp-session-resume-recovery-msg}
 We have omitted the logging procedure (only focusing the different messages).
 As defined in the crash recovery draft {{?I-D.draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery}},
 there are a set of messages that are exchanged between the recovered
 gateway and counterparty gateway:


 - RECOVER: when a gateway crashes and recovers,
 it sends a RECOVER message to the counterparty gateway,
 informing them of its most recent state.
 The message contains various parameters such as the session ID,
 message type, SATP stage, sequence number,
 a flag indicating if the sender is a backup gateway,
 the new public key if the sender is a backup,
 the timestamp of the last known log entry, and the sender's digital signature.

 - RECOVER-UPDATE: Upon receiving the RECOVER message,
 the counterparty gateway sends a RECOVER-UPDATE message.
 This message carries the difference between the log entry
 corresponding to the received sequence number from the
 recovered gateway and the latest sequence number
 (corresponding to the latest log entry).
 The message includes parameters such as the session ID, message type,
 the hash of the previous message, the list of log messages that
 the recovered gateway needs to update, and the sender's digital signature.

 - RECOVER-SUCCESS: The recovered gateway responds with
 a RECOVER-SUCCESS message if its logs have been successfully updated.
 If there are inconsistencies detected,
 the recovered gateway initiates a dispute with a RECOVER-DISPUTE message.
 The message parameters include session ID, message type,
 the hash of the previous message, a boolean indicating success,
 a list of hashes of log entries that were appended to the
 recovered gateway log, and the sender's digital signature.


 In case the recovery procedure has failed and a rollback process
 is needed, the following messages are used:

 - ROLLBACK: A gateway that initiates a rollback sends a ROLLBACK message.
 The message parameters include session ID, message type,
 a boolean indicating success, a list of actions performed
 to rollback a state (e.g., UNLOCK, BURN), a list of proofs
 specific to the DLT [SATP], and the sender's digital signature.

 - ROLLBACK-ACK: Upon successful rollback, the counterparty
 gateway sends a ROLLBACK-ACK message to the recovered gateway acknowledging
 that the rollback has been performed successfully.
 The message parameters are similar to those of the ROLLBACK message.




# Error Messages
{: #satp-alert-error-messages}
SATP SATP distinguishes between
application driven closures (terminations) and
those caused by errors at the SATP protocol level.

The list of errors and desciption can be found in the Appendix.

~~~
enum { session_closure(1), nonfatal_error (2) fatal_error(3), (255) } AlertLevel;

enum {
 close_notify(0),
 bad_certificate(42),
 unsupported_certificate(43),
 certificate_revoked(44),
 certificate_expired(45),
 certificate_unknown(46),
 illegal_parameter(47),
 TBD
 (255)
} AlertDescription;

struct {
 AlertLevel level;
 AlertDescription description;
} Alert;
~~~
{: #fig-error-format}


## Closure Alerts
{: #satp-closure-alerts-section}

 The SATP client and server (gateways) must share knowledge that
 the transfer connection is ending in order to avoid third party attacks.

 (a) close_notify: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender gateway
 will not send any more messages on this transfer connection.
 Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored.

 (b) user_canceled: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender gateway
 is canceling the transfer connection for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure.




## Error Alerts
{: #error-alerts-section}
When an error is detected by a SATP gateway, the detecting gateway sends a message to its peer.

 Upon transmission or receipt of a fatal alert message, both gateways MUST immediately close the connection.
 Whenever a SATP implementation encounters a fatal error condition,
 it SHOULD send an appropriate fatal alert and
 MUST close the connection without sending or receiving any additional data.

 The following error alerts are defined:


 - connection_error: There is an error in the TLS session establishment
 (TLS error codes should be reported-up to gateway level)

 - bad_certificate: The gateway certificate was corrupt, contained signatures,
 that did not verify correctly, etc.
 (Some common TLS level errors: unsupported_certificate,
 certificate_revoked, certificate_expired, certificate_unknown, unknown_ca).

 - protocol_version_error: The SATP protocol version the peer
 has attempted to negotiate is recognized but not supported.

 - (Others TBD)



# Security Consideration
{: #satp-Security-Consideration}
Gateways are of particular interest to attackers because
they are a kind of end-to-end pipeline that enable the transferral of
digital assets to external networks or systems.
Thus, attacking a gateway may be attractive to attackers instead of
the network behind a gateway.

As such, hardware hardening technologies and
tamper-resistant crypto-processors (e.g. TPM, Secure Enclaves, SGX)
should be considered for implementations of gateways.



# IANA Consideration
{: #satp-iana-Consideration}
(TBD)




# Appendix A: API1 Considerations
{: #api1-consideration-section}
 In this section we discuss some considerations regarding the interaction between the Application and a Gateway through API1.

 
## Digital Asset Resource Descriptors
{: #satp-resource-descriptor-sec}

Resources are identified by URL [RFC1738]:

- Type: `application/satres`
- Access Protocol: SATP

Data included in the URL:

### Organization Identifier
{: #satp-org-id-sec}

This MAY be a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) or another identifier linking resource ownership to a real-world entity. Any scheme for identifying gateway owners may be implemented (e.g., LEI directory, closed user group membership, SWIFT BIC, etc.).

The developer or application MAY validate the identity with the issuing authority. The identifier is not a trusted identity but MAY be relied upon where trust has been established between the two parties (e.g., in a closed user group).

The mechanisms to determine organization identifiers are out of scope for the current specification.

### Gateway / Endpoint ID
{: #satp-gateway-id-sec}

FQDN of the SATP compliant gateway. Required to establish IP connectivity. This MUST resolve to a valid IP address.

### Network or System Identifier
{: #satp-dlt-id-sec}

Specific to the gateway behind which the target network operates. This field is local to the gateway and is used to direct SATP interactions to the correct underlying network. This value may be alphanumeric or a hexadecimal value.

For example: "tradelens-network", "EU-supply-chain".

### Network Resource
{: #satp-network-resource-sec}

Specifies a resource held on the underlying network. This field must be meaningful to the network in question but is otherwise an arbitrary string. The underlying object it points to may be a network address, data block, transaction ID, alias, etc. or a future object type not yet defined.

### Examples
{: #satp-resource-example-sec}

The following illustrates using example.com as the endpoint:

satpres://example/api.gateway1.com/swift

## Digital Asset Resource Client Descriptors
{: #satp-clientresource-descriptor-sec}

Resources are identified by URN as described below:
- The type is new: application/satpclient

The URN format does not imply availability of access protocol.

Data included in the URN includes the following:

### Organization Identifier
{: #satp-client-org-id-sec}

Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) or other identifier linking resource ownership to a real-world entity. Any scheme for identifying Gateway owners may be implemented (e.g. LEI directory, closed user group membership, BIC, etc.).

The Gateway MAY validate the identity with the issuing authority. The identifier is not a trusted identity, but MAY be relied on where trust has been established between the two parties (e.g. in a closed user group).

### Gateway / Endpoint ID
{: #satp-client-gateway-id-sec}

Applications which interact with multiple networks can operate in a mode whereby the application connects to its local gateway, which then forwards application traffic to local networks and to remote networks via other SATP gateways.

Where this is the case, this field identifies the "home" gateway for this application. This may be required to carry out gateway to gateway handshaking and protocol negotiation, or for the server to look up use case specific data relating to the client.

### Organizational Unit
{: #satp-client-org-unit-sec}

The organization unit within the organization that the client (application or developer) belongs to. This assertion should be backed up with authentication via the negotiated protocol.

The purpose of this field is to allow gateways to maintain access control mapping between applications and resources that are independent of the authentication and authorization schemes used, supporting future changes and supporting counterparties that operate different schemes.

### Name
{: #satp-client-dlt-resource-sec}

A locally unique (within the OU) identifier, which can identify the application, project, or individual developer responsible for this client connection. This is the most granular unit of access control, and gateways should ensure appropriate identifiers are used for the needs of the application or use case.

### Examples
{: #satp-client-resource-example-sec}

The following illustrates using example.com as the endpoint:

satpclient:example/api.gatewayserver.example.com/research/luke.riley

## Gateway Level Access Control
{: #satp-gateway-access-sec}

Gateways can enforce access rules based on standard naming conventions using novel or existing mechanisms such as AuthZ protocols using the resource identifiers above, for example:

satpclient:////mybank/api.gatewayserver.mybank.com/lending/eric.devloper

can READ/WRITE

satpres://example/api.gateway1.com/tradelens

AND

satpres://example/api.gateway1.com/ripple

These rules would allow a client so identified to access resources directly, for example:

satpres://example/api.gateway1.com/tradelens/xxxxxADDRESSxxxxx

This method allows resource owners to easily grant access to individuals, groups, and organizations. Individual gateway implementations may implement access controls, including subsetting and supersetting of applications or resources according to their own requirements.



## Application Profile Negotiation
{: #satp-application-profile-negotiation}

Where an application relies on specific extensions for operation, these can be represented in an Application Profile. For example, a payments application that tracks payments using a cloud-based API and interacts only with gateways logging messages to that API can establish a resource profile as follows:

    Application Name: TRACKER
    X-Tracker_URL: https://api.tracker.com/updates
    X-Tracking-Policy: Always

As gateways implement this functionality, they support the TRACKER application profile, and the application is able to expand its reach by periodically polling for the availability of the profile.

This is an intentionally generalized extension mechanism for application or vendor specific functionality.


## Discovery of Digital Asset Resources
{: #satp-resource-discovery-sec}

Applications located outside a network or system SHOULD be able to discover which resources they are authorized to access in a network or system.

Resource discovery is handled by the gateway in front of the network. For instance using a GETrequest against the gateway URL with no resource identifier could return a list of URLs available to the requester. This list issubject to the access controls above.

Gateways MAY allow applications to discover resources they do not have access to. This should be indicated in the free text field, and gateways SHOULD implement a process for applications to request access.

Formal specification of supported resource discovery methods is out of scope of this document.





# Appendix B: API3 Considerations
{: #api3-consideration-section}
 In this section we discuss some considerations regarding the interaction between a gateway and an external resource or service provider through API3.
